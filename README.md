# Palindrome Checker

Welcome to Day 4 of my 100-day journey of creating something new every day! Today, I've developed a Palindrome Checker using HTML and JavaScript. This project helps users check if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Create a Palindrome Checker application where users can input text to determine if it reads the same backward as forward.

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
